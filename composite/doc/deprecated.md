Deprecated Interfaces
=====================

It is highly unlikely that these interfaces will survive much longer.
If you are creating a new component and are tempted to use these,
think again.  There are probably other, better, options.  Ask on the
mailing list what these are.

- cgraph
- stack_trace
- sched_conf
- cinfo
- fd
- static_content
- http
- content_mux
- async_inv

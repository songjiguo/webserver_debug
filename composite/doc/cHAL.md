The _Composite_ Hardware Abstraction Layer
==========================================

The _Composite_ Hardware Abstraction Layer, or _Hijack_ Abstraction
Layer, (_cHAL_) is the layer that defines the platform-specific
functionality that requires specific implementations not only for
different architectures (e.g. x86-32 vs. -64), but also when booting
from the bare-metal versus using the Hijack techniques.  This file
documents the functions that must be implemented within the platform
code, and how they interact with the _Composite_ kernel proper.

This file is going to include many stages of the _cHAL_, starting from
rough notes on which functions are going to be in it, and proceeding
to a final stage that includes only the set of interfaces, and their
perscribed use and documentation.  The path to rational documentation
will be documented itself in the commit history.

Notes on the Hardware and Kernel Control Paths
----------------------------------------------

**Kernel call-backs.** The hardware-entry points for system calls,
faults, exceptions, and interrupts must be in the _cHAL_.  Only the
platform-specific code will know how to configure registers,
etc. (this raises the question of how we can have platform-specific
user-level code that understands the register passing conventions, but
that is for another day), let alone how to configure the hardware to
respect a given set of entry-points.  This implies that we must define
the interface within the _Composite_ kernel that is invoked by the
platform sepecific code.  This requirement spans beyond just the
hardware-specific entry points, and includes high-level interrupts
such as the timer interrupt, handling network interrupts, and handling
translator events.  However, this does define (as far as I know right
now) the full set of call-backs into the kernel from the
platorm-specific code.

**Platform services.** The set of services provided by platform
specific code are hinted at by the set of undefined functions within
the kernel.  See below for a list of these.


On Directory/Code Structure
---------------------------

We need not only to produce and object that the kernel can be linked
with that satisfies all of the kernel's undefined functions, but also
an include directory that includes not only the interface for the
platform services, but also some of their implementations.  The
services that are required to be implemented in header files is small,
and constitutes only the small set of functions required on the
invocation fast-path (for now, I only know about the
`switch_host_pg_tbls` function).  Unfortunately, this _does_ mean that
we can't just have a single static include directory that includes the
prototypes for the functional interface between kernel and platform
services, but also include files that include specific
implementations.  This will probably require a symlink for the include
directory.

The include directory should be in `src/platform/include`, with a
`src/platform/include/platform_specific.h` file that is a symlink to
the appropriate file in e.g. `src/platform/linux/`.  That file is
included from `chal.h`.

Programmatically Determining Undefined Symbols in the Kernel
------------------------------------------------------------

`cd src/kernel/; ld *.o -o all.o 2> undef.txt; grep "undefined reference to" undef.txt | sed "s/.*\`\(.*\)'.*/\1/" | sort | uniq ; rm undef.txt`

results in the following list of undefined functions (@

 * FIXME: The API currently requires the valloc be done in the client,
 * and the cbuf_mgr simply uses this address to map the corresponding
 * memory into.  Later the cbuf_mgr will valloc_free the memory region
 * when it wants the memory back.  This asymmetry is a little
 * worrysome as it is unclear who is "responsible" for tracking the
 * memory.  
 *
 * A solution is to not pass the void *page in this interface, and
 * instead return the vaddrs of the memory that was allocated in
 * cbuf_mgr.  The problem is that for cbuf_c_create, we need to return
 * 2 values in that case.  Thus, we will probably end up passing the
 * cbufid in the page that is returned.  For now, use the current
 * design where both components are using valloc_*.
